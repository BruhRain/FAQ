# Kicked from Roblox - 268



* This usually indicates you have been shadow banned from Roblox for one hour. Make sure you're using the [latest UI available](https://k-storage.com/krnl_beta.exe) to prevent this. Don't launch Roblox for an hour.
Alternatively, log out of Roblox, reinstall it and log into a different account until the hour has passed.

* [Enable auto-attach](https://i.imgur.com/d4Q8BjJ.png) in the preferences tab of the [latest UI](https://k-storage.com/krnl_beta.exe) after you've waited an hour.

# IMPORTANT
**To Prevent "Error Code 268" Kicks, DO NOT Use 3rd Party Injectors such as "Extreme Injector" / "Dll Injectors"; Instead use "Auto Attach" on the krnl beta ui or regular legacy krnl!**
