Krnl, like ANY other roblox exploit will be marked as a virus, this is known as a "False postive" where windows thinks the "Krnl.dll" file is a virus due to it being obfuscated, rest assured Krnl is 100% safe.
You can actually decompile the entire UI using DN spy.

Lets start by whitelisting Krnl from windows Anti Virus.

1.) Open Settings, and type "Windows security", It should open the windows security panel from there.

2.) Open The "Virus and Threat Protection" Option.

3.) You'll want to navigate To [Here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/903380408597614623/1013506105420283934/unknown.png), Then turn off the first option "Real Time Protection".

**NOTE: IF YOU DON'T WANT TO TURN OFF YOUR WHOLE ANTI VIRUS BUT INSTEAD JUST WHITELIST KRNL READ BELOW**
