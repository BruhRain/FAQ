# Stuck at correct key
This issue is relatively simple to solve. While you're stuck at "correct key", open task manager, find Roblox and kill the instance.
If you are using the latest Krnl UI, you can click the dropdown button on the left hand side and press "Close Roblox".

After this, rejoin your game and get a new key!
