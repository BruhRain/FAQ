This issue is actually the stuck at waiting for Roblox issue but camouflaged. Its caused by one of the hooks that are made by Krnl at injection overwritten by another application eg. Msi Afterburner.

To fix this close all apps running in the background (Check the system app tray!) and reopen Roblox then try injecting Krnl again.
